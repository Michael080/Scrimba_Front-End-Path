      <h2>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</h2>  
      <p>
          <strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much. 
          
          Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="light">How I turned things around</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything</strong>. I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job. It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
      </p>  
        
      
      <h2 class="light">Now I live the simple life</h2>  
      <p>
        Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
